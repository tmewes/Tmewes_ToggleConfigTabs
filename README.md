Tmewes_ToggleConfigTabs
=====================
Creates a button in the admin system configuration for opening/closing all config tabs on the current page at once instead of clicking every single one to see all contents.

### Facts

- version: 0.1.0
- [extension on GitHub](https://github.com/tmewes/Tmewes_ToggleConfigTabs)
- [direct download link](https://github.com/tmewes/Tmewes_ToggleConfigTabs/archive/master.zip)

### Motivation

While comparing the system configuration of several shop instances it was too annoying for me to open each configuration tab individually to see all the contents of the page.
Maybe one or another knows about this situation, so this is for you all. :)
